"""Render coherence under a rigid downward translation of a grid row.

Translating a row (its sections, their stations and their ports) by a small
amount is layout-neutral: nothing inside the row moves relative to anything
else in it.  Junction stations, though, live outside any section, and their
coordinates are derived rather than authored - a fan-out junction is pinned to
the Y of the exit port that feeds it, a merge junction to the Y of the entry
port it feeds.  A translation that leaves a junction at its old Y strands it
off the bundle it belongs to, and the exit-port-to-junction connector
degenerates into a dogleg too short to carry a curve radius.

``examples/topologies/complex_multipath.mmd`` exposes this: its
``full_preprocess`` right-exit fan-out junction sits ``JUNCTION_MARGIN`` from
the exit port, so a few pixels of stranding is enough to turn a straight
connector into a sub-radius Z.

A graph-wide rail layout is the one place where the port-derived placement is
not the authority: it seats junctions on per-line rail Ys instead, so the
re-derivation must leave those alone.
