"""Legs that co-travel are grouped, however far apart the ordered scan looks.

:func:`~nf_metro.layout.routing.normalize._corridor_bundles` walks one axis's
legs in coordinate order and stops testing a leg once no later one can reach it.
That cutoff and the predicate deciding whether a pair co-travels are the same
distance, so a pair the predicate would group is never skipped by the scan.  When
the two disagreed, a pair further apart than the cutoff but closer than the
predicate's reach was left ungrouped and free to move independently, which
destroys the spacing that draws them as separate strokes.

Being close laterally is only half of it: the pair also has to share a stretch
of corridor, read the same way a peer's claim on the gap is read, so two legs
handing over across an elbow stay free of each other.
