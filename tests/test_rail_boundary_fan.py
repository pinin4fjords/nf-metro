"""Invariant tests for a bundle crossing into a per-section rail-mode section.

A ``%%metro line_spread: rails | <section>`` section lays each of its lines on
its own horizontal rail, and a station several lines pass through renders as an
interchange pill spanning those rails.  A multi-line bundle arriving from an
adjacent bundled section must therefore separate on the way in so each line
meets the pill on *its own* rail, the way the lines leaving that pill each run
along their own rail to their downstream station.  Landing the whole bundle at
the pill's centre Y instead draws the incoming lines diving into the middle of
the pill body.

The oracle reconstructs the routed geometry through
:func:`layout_metrics.measured_geometry` and checks it independently of the
rail-boundary handler.
