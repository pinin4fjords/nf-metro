"""A line carrying a bundle offset must meet its perpendicular port at one X.

When a line splits off a shared multi-line trunk it carries a non-zero
within-bundle offset.  If that line then crosses into a section through a
``entry: top`` or ``entry: bottom`` port, its inter-section leg and the
section's intra-section drop share that single port marker.  The approach must
therefore land on the X that drop departs from; landing on the inbound offset
instead parts the two legs at the section edge -- a boundary jitter where the
stroke steps sideways as it crosses.

``top_entry_bundle_offset_seam`` is the committed minimal fixture: line ``b``
splits off the ``a,b,c`` trunk at a junction (giving it a non-zero offset) and
drops into ``dst`` through its ``entry: top`` port, whose own drop departs from
the port's bare X, so the inbound offset has to taper away.
``fold_left_exit_right_entry`` carries an offset-free top/side entry and guards
the zero-offset case.  ``bottom_entry_same_row_boundary`` and
``entry_hint_shared_edge`` carry a two-line bundle into a ``entry: bottom``
port whose drop *does* fan the lines apart, and so pin the opposite sign: a
BOTTOM approach is reached ascending, so the same landing X reads as the
opposite lateral to a TOP one.
``lr_perpendicular_ports_overflow`` guards a feeder leaving through a RIGHT
exit: the descent cannot occupy the exit's own column, so the port stands in
the column the descent occupies.
