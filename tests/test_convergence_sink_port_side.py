"""A fold-relocated section's flow-axis port faces its connecting sections (#1167).

When a lowered ``fold_threshold`` relocates sections onto a return row, a
directive authored for the unfolded layout (e.g. ``%%metro exit: right`` written
when the consumer sat to the right) can end up facing *away* from the grid side
its connecting section occupies.  The connecting leg then wraps back across the
section's own box, which the routing self-check rejects.

The invariant: for a section the fold relocated, a left/right entry/exit port on
its flow axis sits on the same horizontal side as the sections it connects to,
whenever those all sit strictly to one side.  ``genomeassembly`` under a lowered
fold is the real-pipeline case (#1167, residual of #1085); the parametrised
sweep exercises the property across several gallery fixtures so it generalises.
