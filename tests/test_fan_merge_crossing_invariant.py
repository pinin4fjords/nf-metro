"""Tests for the vertical-flow fork/merge partition-crossing invariant.

A vertical-flow (TB/BT) section is the horizontal model rotated 90 degrees, so a
rotation must preserve the horizontal layout's non-crossing.  At a fork or merge,
two distinct lines that each reach exactly one in-section neighbour must leave or
dock in those neighbours' lane (column) order; when the lane sign transposes that
order the two routes cross between the station and where they peel apart.  The
bundle-mate guard cannot see it -- the crossing lines ride different edges -- and
the fan-out-junction guard skips it, since these forks/merges have no junction.

Covers:

* Happy-path: every gallery example and topology fixture routes its
  vertical-flow forks/merges without a partition crossing.
* The seam-free regression trio (``tb_convergence_straight_drop``,
  ``tb_passthrough_continuation``, ``tb_trunk_through_fan``) is crossing-free.
* Meaningfulness: with the seam-free positive-fan classification disabled the
  checker fires on all three, so the invariant genuinely encodes the bug.
