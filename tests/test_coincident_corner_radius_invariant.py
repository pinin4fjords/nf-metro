"""Same-line legs fused onto one channel must share their turn radius.

:func:`_coincide_same_line_tracks` snaps several same-line vertical legs onto
one reference X, so they read as a single stroke.  Each leg carries the
flanking-corner radius its own handler assigned: a plain solo leg gets the base
radius, while a leg that is the outer member of a concentric multi-line bundle
gets a wider one.  Where the fused legs share a turn vertex the two arcs draw
concentrically a few pixels apart -- a doubled corner.

``check_concentric_bundle_corners`` deliberately skips this case (it tests
*offset* bundle-mates, which nest by design); ``check_coincident_corner_radii``
covers it. Planning freezes owned cohorts through
:func:`_unify_coincident_corner_radii`, while the post-emission call settles
only wholly unowned cohorts.

Covers:

* Corpus: no shipped fixture routes a same-line turn shared by two legs with
  unequal resolved radii.
* Meaningfulness: a hand-planted radius mismatch at a coincident corner is
  caught, so the corpus check is not vacuous.
