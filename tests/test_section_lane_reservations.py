"""No lane a section hands its stations may be reserved for nobody.

A level no line of the section rides at any of its stations reserves nothing, so
no marker should stretch to span it.  Scanned over the whole ``.mmd`` corpus
rather than one fixture, because the lane a line lands on is decided from the
section's line set and so every section is a candidate.

A line cut mid-section and rejoining on a different lane is deliberately *not*
asserted against: the alternative is to hold its far lane at every stop, which
reserves a level the nearer stations do not need and grows their markers, so the
step is the cheaper of the two and not a defect on its own.

``compact_offsets`` graphs are out of scope: that mode sizes each station's
bundle from the station's own line count, so a line there legitimately rides
different lanes at different stations.  Rail-laid sections are out of scope too
-- they draw from absolute rail coordinates, not lanes.
