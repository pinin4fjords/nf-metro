"""The granted-clearance arm of short-destination cohort settling bites.

``_settle_plannable_short_destination_cohorts`` publishes no settled turn on any
shipped or generated input, which makes the arm that runs once a boundary
clearance is *granted* look unreachable.  It is not: the grant is the only route
to the re-seating loop at the end of that pass, and emptying the granted-owner
set changes the SVG of the fixture named here.

The effect is visible only along the render's settlement path -- laying the
fixture out and re-routing it from scratch reproduces the same coordinates
either way -- so the assertion is made on the rendered document.
