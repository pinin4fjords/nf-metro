"""A port keeps clearance from the box edges it is not anchored to.

Every port is pinned to one edge of its section's bounding box: a LEFT/RIGHT
port to a vertical edge, a TOP/BOTTOM port to a horizontal one.  Along its
*other* axis the port is free, and landing it flush on a second edge draws the
inbound run along the box border, where the route and the border read as one
stroke.  It also starves the section header: with a route on the top edge the
above-left position is never clear, so the placement chain falls through to
``nudge`` and the number badge slides right, away from the box it labels.

``_compact_row_content_to_bbox_top`` (Stage 5.4) is what pulls a perpendicular
port toward the top edge, and it reserves ``PERP_PORT_EDGE_CLEARANCE`` so the
port stops short of it.

Every clearance here is measured from the port's outermost *drawn* lane, not from
the port station: the bundle crossing a port is staggered off it along exactly
the free axis these clearances are measured on, so a station well clear of the
border can still have its outer lane riding it.

Covers:

* Corpus: no shipped fixture seats a port's drawn bundle flush on an unanchored
  box edge, and every perpendicular port on a vertical flow keeps the full
  ``PERP_PORT_EDGE_INSET`` from the flow-axis edge it faces.
* Meaningfulness: a hand-planted flush port is caught, and so is one whose
  station is clear while its bundle is not, so neither corpus check is vacuous.
* Rotation: the bundle sits on the same side of a LEFT/RIGHT port under a TB flow
  and its BT mirror, since the run carrying it is horizontal either way.
* Regression: ``tb_exit_terminal_on_carrier``'s carrier row keeps entry-port
  headroom and anchors its header at the box's top-left corner.
