"""Tests for the distinct-line fan-out divergence invariant.

When distinct lines leave one section through a shared exit junction and drop to
different columns on another row, they should descend as one concentric bundle
and split only where each line peels into its target.  The near line peeling
onto the wrong side of the descent, or a lead-in Y order out of phase with the
descent X order, makes the two colours cross in open space instead of running
parallel (issue #719).

Covers:

* Happy-path: every gallery example and topology fixture (including
  ``dogleg_twoline_fanout``, the reported defect, and the upward variant)
  routes its clean-divergence fan-outs without a crossing.
* Meaningfulness: a crossing planted at the routed-geometry boundary fires the
  checker, independent of the production phase that prevents it.
