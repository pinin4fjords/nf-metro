"""The canvas holds ink drawn outside the section-box envelope.

A route that runs left of, or above, every section box is outside the envelope
the boxes were placed with, so the margin that envelope leaves says nothing
about how much room the route has.  The canvas grows past the rightmost and
bottommost ink already; these tests hold the same for the two margins whose
edge sits at the coordinate origin, where the ink has nowhere to go and is
drawn against -- or beyond -- the canvas edge instead.

They also hold that the boundary those margins settle on is the one a
content-framed decoration is placed against: a legend the author left unpinned
sits on the edge of the drawn content, whether a box or a run defines it.
