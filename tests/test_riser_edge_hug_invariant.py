"""Tests for the riser-hugs-section-edge invariant.

A TOP-entry lead-in that rises through the gap between two same-row sections
must climb the middle of the gap, not one wall.  When the minimal lead-in seats
the vertical riser one curve radius off the source box's exit edge, the line
renders as running up the outside of the box -- the ``riboseq_fold_two_dir_entry``
fold corner, where ``orf_calling -> psite_id`` climbed ``orf_calling``'s left edge.

Covers:

* Happy-path: every shipped topology and example routes with no riser hugging a
  section edge.
* Targeted: ``riboseq_fold_two_dir_entry`` seats its ``orf_calling -> psite_id``
  back-connection midway in the corridor between ``psite_id`` and ``orf_calling``.
* Meaningfulness: seating that same riser one curve radius off ``orf_calling``'s
  wall makes the checker report it, so the invariant genuinely encodes the bug.
  The hugging geometry is authored rather than coaxed out of the router, because
  several routing passes independently seat a riser clear of a wall and a proof
  of non-vacuity must not rest on defeating each of them.
