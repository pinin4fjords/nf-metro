"""Tests for the TB trunk-continuation straight-drop invariant.

In a TB fan-out where one line continues straight down the trunk column (sharing
the hub's X with its child) while a sibling peels off to another column, the
continuing line must drop straight.  A vertical section draws each line at the
rotation ``x + sign * offset`` with a per-line-constant offset, so a
continuation keeps one lane the length of its trunk and drops straight by
construction; the same holds for a collinear feeder into a terminal merge.

Covers the happy-path: every gallery example and topology fixture (including
``tb_trunk_through_fan`` and ``tb_convergence_straight_drop``, the reported
defects) routes every same-lane continuation edge as a straight run.
