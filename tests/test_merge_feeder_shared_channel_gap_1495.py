"""Fused merge feeders keep a truthful gap-slot declaration (#1495).

When two feeders reach one merge junction and a packed cell-mate pushes their
shared descent into an inter-column gap, :func:`_coincide_same_line_tracks`
fuses the branch feeder's opening descent onto the trunk feeder's descent
column.  The relocation crossed a gap boundary but left the branch feeder's
:class:`GapSlot` declared at its pre-fusion column, so
:func:`check_gap_channels_materialized` saw the relocated leg in a gap with no
matching slot and aborted the render.

The repro is a valid map: two fan sources (``src_fanA``/``src_fanB``) each feed
both ``target`` and ``side_a``; a packed ``left_mate`` cell-mate reshapes the
columns so the shared merge channel lands inside a gap.  The remaining fixtures
are gallery topologies with their own merge-feeder descents, so the invariant
generalises beyond the repro.
