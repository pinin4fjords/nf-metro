"""A bottommost-row merge trunk keeps the inter-row channel it was reserved.

The trunk that collects a merge's cross-row feeders runs a horizontal channel in
the gap above the bottom row, bounded by the row envelopes: it crosses every
upper-row box on its way to a target that need share no column with any of them,
and the parser has rewritten its authored connectors through fan and merge nodes
so no section pair records the relationship at all.  ``_enforce_min_row_gaps``
reserves that gap envelope-wide; the row cascade that runs afterwards
(``_tighten_lower_rows_after_shrink`` and ``push_lower_rows_after_bbox_grow``)
must measure it the same way, or it closes the reservation against a
column-overlapping pair the corridor never travels between and the trunk is left
crossing the box that bounds it (#1593; the resulting pass-through is locked by
``test_inter_row_gap_reserved_1312``).

Within that gap the channel level is where the trunk's own track runs -- the
level its branch feeders drop onto -- so the drawn traverse has to land on it
rather than half a bundle step off it, which is what leaves the settled
corridor's realised coordinate outside the band its reservation allocates.
