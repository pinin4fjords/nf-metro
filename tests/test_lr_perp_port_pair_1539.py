"""An LR section carrying both of its perpendicular ports keeps its run in its box
and turns out of the BOTTOM exit through one clean bundle corner.

A ``%%metro entry: top`` plus ``%%metro exit: bottom`` on an LR section leaves it
with no flow-aligned port.  The perpendicular-entry runway shift then moves the
whole run along X, and three things have to follow it: the section's own right
edge, the BOTTOM exit's drop column, and the per-line lane order the exit corner
turns.  Where any one lags, the trailing station leaves its box, the exit leg
doubles back over the run, and the bundle's lanes swap sides through the bend.
