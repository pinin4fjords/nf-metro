    A line leaving one fan on several branches still occupies a single slot in
    the source bundle, so its branches have to sort as one contiguous block: a
    distinct line ranked between two of them cannot be served by either slot
    order, and the fan has no crossing-free per-line permutation.

    Contiguity alone is not enough to merge them.  Slots are handed out by index
    and each target's entry port inherits the lane its own branch holds, so
    merging two slots renumbers every slot beyond them and leaves the lines out
    there on lanes their ports never inherited.  Only the trailing slots can
    therefore merge.  The merged branches also have to want that one lane: they
    must share a *slot shape* -- the column reach and band classification the
    order sorts on -- and none of them may run on the source row, where the run
    is flat only while it keeps the lane its target's entry port inherited.

    The block also has to own every *stack depth* it spans -- ``stack_depth``
    being the coordinate this fan's lanes stack on, the one the incoming order
    sorted them by.  One slot across several depths leaves nothing to rank a
    distinct line that stacks at one of them: it reaches a different target at
    the same depth, so it reaches it by running past that depth, a descent the
    coordinate it tied on does not express.  Either way round, one of the two
    lays its riser across the other's flat run in.  The fan declines rather
    than claim a crossing-free order it has no coordinate to derive.

    That tie test is the whole ownership question only while the incoming order
    is itself sorted by the depth the lanes peel at: the block trails, so it is
    then the deepest thing in the fan and a tie is the only way a distinct line
    can reach past it.  An order sorted on some other coordinate carries no such
    guarantee, and callers on those orders pass ``peel_depth`` -- the distance
    from the source row at which each branch leaves the bundle.  The block runs
    innermost, so its peel-offs travel outward across every lane outside it that
    has not already turned away; the merge holds only while every distinct line
    peels strictly nearer the source row than the block's nearest peel.
